We are working on a localization project using RSSI.
We create a fingerprinting map of a house by measuring the RSSI values at different locations.
You are provided some incomplete fingerprinting data (as a json file), where half of the required samples with ids between 1 and 32 (both inclusive) are required.
Note that each id has the format "<id>.<dir>", where dir is 1-4. Please generate all 4 directions for each id, just like the input data.
You are also provided with an image of the floorplan, along with the locations of all of the samples you should choose.
Finally, you are provided with the real location data.
Please generate the remaining half of the values, and return the complete data-set as JSON as a downloadable file.
Your output json must be formatted exactly like my input json.
